    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <h2>Work experience</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>MUSC Technical assistant</li>
            <p>Worked as an assistant under Dr. Roberts, helping to maintain a processing pipeline for astronaut brain scans. The 
                previous architect of this pipeline left unexpectedly and was unavailable for contact, so my duties were to document 
                file structures, reverse engineer BASH script functions, and compile data for trend analysis. 
            </p>
            <li>NIWC Atlantic - VM Automation</li>
            <p>Used YAML to automate the deployment of six uniquely built programs. This allowed numerous Virtual Machines to be spun 
                up quickly for testing and made it easier for troops to deploy these programs on their equipment.
            </p>
            <li>NIWC Atlantic - Technical Writer</li>
            <p>Edited and created various technical documents for the deployment of improved equipment. This required coordination with
                six separate teams and a keen attention to detail. Also began development of a website for the automation of document 
                creation.
            </p>
            <li>NIWC Atlantic - VIDS Developer</li>
